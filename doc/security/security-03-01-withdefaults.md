# withDefaults
The Customizer.withDefaults() method is a utility method provided by Spring Security to simplify the configuration of some common security features. Specifically, Customizer.withDefaults() is **used to configure the default settings** for a particular security feature, such as form login, HTTP basic authentication, or simple authentication for RSocket security.

Here are some key points to keep in mind regarding Customizer.withDefaults():

* Customizer.withDefaults() is a static method provided by the org.springframework.security.config.Customizer class.
* The method returns an instance of the appropriate **Customizer implementation** for the security feature being configured.
* For example, if you call http.formLogin(Customizer.withDefaults()) in your configure(HttpSecurity http) method, Spring Security will automatically configure the default settings for form login, such as the login page URL and the login processing URL.
* You can customize the default settings further by chaining additional methods onto the Customizer instance returned by Customizer.withDefaults().
* For example, you might call http.formLogin(Customizer.withDefaults()).loginPage("/my-login-page") to specify a custom login page URL.
